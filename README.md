# Tweeter-Sentiment-Analysis-using NLP
**Objective:** This project aims to develop a **light-weight, non-deployed** sentiment analysis system for Twitter data using Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques. It will **avoid complex models** like LSTMs and transformers, focusing on efficient and interpretable methods.

**Motivation:**

* **Understanding public opinion:** Twitter offers a real-time snapshot of public sentiment on various topics. Analyzing this sentiment can provide valuable insights for researchers, businesses, and government agencies.
* **Exploring NLP without advanced models:** This project offers a practical entry point to NLP by employing fundamental techniques and avoiding computationally expensive deep learning models.
* **Interpretability and explainability:** By focusing on simpler algorithms, the project prioritizes clear explanations of why certain tweets are classified as positive, negative, or neutral.

**Methodology:**

1. **Data Acquisition:** Collect a labeled dataset of tweets with sentiment annotations (e.g., positive, negative, neutral). Popular sources include Twitter APIs and Kaggle datasets.
2. **Data Preprocessing:** Clean and pre-process the tweets, including tasks like removing noise, handling slang, and stemming/lemmatization.
3. **Feature Engineering:** Extract linguistic features from the tweets, such as n-grams, word sentiment dictionaries, and POS tags.
4. **Model Training and Evaluation:** Train a sentiment classification model using traditional machine learning algorithms like Naive Bayes, Support Vector Machines, or Logistic Regression. Evaluate the model's performance using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score.
5. **Error Analysis and Refinement:** Analyze the model's errors and identify areas for improvement. This may involve refining features, trying different algorithms, or tuning hyperparameters.
6. **Visualization and Insights:** Generate visualizations of the results, including sentiment distribution across topics, influential users, and word clouds of positive and negative sentiment.

**Deliverables:**

* A functional sentiment analysis system using a chosen NLP algorithm.
* A report outlining the implemented techniques, model performance, and insights gained from the analysis.
* Visualizations and interactive charts showcasing the tweet sentiment and key findings.

**Exclusions:**

* This project will not involve deployment or building a user interface. The focus is solely on the algorithmic analysis of Twitter sentiment.
* Complex deep learning models like LSTMs and transformers will be avoided in favor of interpretable and lightweight methods.

**Expected Outcomes:**

* Gaining practical experience with NLP techniques for sentiment analysis.
* Discovering valuable insights into public opinion on Twitter regarding specific topics or events.
* Contributing to the development of efficient and interpretable methods for text analysis.

This project provides a clear framework for exploring Twitter sentiment analysis without relying on complex deep learning models. It emphasizes NLP fundamentals, interpretability, and practical insights, making it suitable for learners and researchers interested in applied NLP and understanding public opinion on social media.
